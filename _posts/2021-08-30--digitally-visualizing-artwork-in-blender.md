# Digitally Visualizing Artwork in Blender

Previewing art in various frames in a simulated environment

## Background

Whenever I look at other artists' profiles, I am jealous of how clean their photos of their art with gorgeous, expensive looking frames with beautiful natural light shining on a bare, clean wall. 

However, I have no such spot in my house, and no fancy camera to take crisp photos with.
