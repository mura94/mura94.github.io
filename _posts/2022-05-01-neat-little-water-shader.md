This is just a little demo of a neat little water shader I whipped up in Shader Graph this afternoon.

Not much to write home about, but it:

- is pretty decent looking for URP
- is only using a quad to render
- is completely procedural
- is very fast (mobile / VR compatible)
- is light baking / GI compatible!
