My name is Blake Jarvis, I'm born and raised in the Seattle area where I currently live with my wife, dog, and cats. 

I have many interests that I will be posting about on this site:

- Developing AR & VR experiences
- Painting
- 3D printing
- Music production & sound design
- Digital media & art

TLDR; I like to make stuff.

Please stay tuned as this site is in progress!
